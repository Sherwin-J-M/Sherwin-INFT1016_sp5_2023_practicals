                <h2 id="Intro">Introduction</h2>        
                <p>In today's interconnected world, technologies and data have become a part of our daily lives. These emerging technologies that have emerged over the years have started playing a vital role in the world of cyber security, where safeguarding one's digital data is vital. These emerging technologies are reshaping how we defend against malicious cyber-attacks. One of the significant technologies that has appeared is “AI,” short for Artificial Intelligence. The application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) for cybersecurity tasks has attracted a greater attention from both sectors, private as well as public as many organizations have become increasingly concerned about protecting their digital assets or data from any unauthorized access. Many organizations have also become a target of these attacks, especially those that fall under small and medium-sized organizations. AI also serves as a double-edged sword, where it can improve cybersecurity substantially and can also facilitate new forms of attacks that can pose cybersecurity with severe security threats.
                    The following report delves into the profound impact of this emerging technology, AI (Artificial Intelligence).

                <p>
                    AI, also known as Artificial Intelligence, is a technology that can understand, learn and act based on its acquired information. It is also said that AI possesses a certain degree of human intelligence. When it comes to cybersecurity, AI is ideally suitable and capable of solving some of the most difficult problems or challenges faced in the realm of cybersecurity. With the constantly ever-evolving cyber-attacks, AI can used as a shield to protect against these attacks through automatic threat detection and also through its more enhanced way of responding more efficiently when compared to approaching traditional software-driven. Machine learning is one of the applications of AI technology.

                <p>
                    Machine learning is also an application of AI technology that uses mathematical data models to help computers to learn without providing direct instruction. This enables computers to constantly continue learning and improving their data on their own based on their experience - 
                    Machine learning is also the most common and primary way most people interact with an AI. Some of these ways are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Receiving video recommendation on an online video platform</li>
                        <li>Scheduling meetings in your calendar, playing a specific song, or calling someone using a virtual assistant who responds to your requests</li>
                    </ul>	
                    <p>Example of how machine learning algorithms are used in cyber security:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Decision tree algorithm—for detecting and classifying attacks</li>
                        <li>K-means clustering—for detecting malware</li>
                        <li>K-nearest neighbours classifier (kNN)—for facial recognition used for authentication</li>
                        <li>Random forest algorithm—for classifying phishing attacks</li>
                        <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm—for classifying, detecting, and predicting blacklisted IP addresses and port addresses  </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Supervised machine learning </li>
                        <li>Semi-supervised machine learning</li>
                        <li>Unsupervised machine learning</li>
                        <li>Reinforcement machine learning</li>

                    Amazon uses AI to detect and block accounts for any potentially suspicious activity, such as fraudulent activity and identify and remove these accounts. E.g., Suppose a customer account is accessed from a different location. In that case, the AI system will mark this as suspicious activity and require the customer to verify their identity before their purchase.

                            Hackers can use AI to benefit themselves by making use of the potential of AI to make their cyberattacks more advanced and avoid any kind of threat detection.Some of the ways they use AI are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Social engineering schemes: This scheme relies on psychological manipulation to trick individuals into revealing their sensitive data/information. They include a broad range of activities in categories such as phishing, scams and other fraudulent activities. These cybercriminals can use AI to create more personalized and sophisticated messaging tools that can fool any unsuspecting victims into revealing their sensitive information.</li>
                            <li>Password hacking: Cybercriminals can exploit AI by improving the algorithms that are used for deciphering passwords. This use can enhance these algorithms to provide for more and quicker accurate guessing of the password, which allows hackers to become even more efficient and profitable in their outcome.</li>
                            <li>Deep fakes: Cybercriminals can use deep fakes by using AI's ability to easily manipulate visual or audio content and make it seem like genuine content. This includes the use of audio and video to impersonate an individual, which can then be broadly distributed online on social media platforms, which can then create stress, fear, or confusion among those who consume it and also lead to reputational damage to the targeted individual or victims.</li>
                            <li>Data poisoning: Hackers can alter or 'poison' the algorithm used by an AI that influences its decision, which can lead it to make wrong decisions or supply false information. By the time the cause is identified, the damage done would already be severe.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p>
                    This report provides a comprehensive overview of AI and the cyber security landscape, offering insights into the advantages as well as disadvantages and evolving roles of AI in safeguarding our digital world.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this digital era where technology and data are part of our daily life, the need for robust cybersecurity measures has never been more critical. The emergence of technology such as AI (Artificial Intelligence) has helped defend against malicious cyber threats in this digital background.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As explained in this report, machine learning is an integral part of AI, which uses mathematical data models to learn and improve autonomously. This technology is all around in our lives, starting from video recommendations to chatbots and virtual assistants, but it finds its most crucial part in the applications of Cybersecurity
                </p>

                <p>
                    The capabilities of AI in Cybersecurity are vast. Cybersecurity has benefitted from using AI to improve their network security, simulating complex attack scenarios, using behavioural biometrics, and providing additional protection against advanced hacking methods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Nevertheless, the implementation of AI also brings forth another set of challenges to Cybersecurity, such as a shortage of skilled professionals, the high cost of specialized software and hardware, and a potential rise in unemployment due to the rise in automation of jobs through AI. Furthermore, Hackers harness the abilities of AI to make their cybersecurity attacks sophisticated by utilizing social engineering schemes, password hacking, deep fakes, and data poisoning.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Despite AI having its drawbacks, the constructive collaboration of AI and Cybersecurity is a dynamic and evolving partnership and continues to expand and has undeniably transformed many organizations' cybersecurity landscape. Some of the notable ones are Amazon, Twitter, Google, and NVIDIA, which have demonstrated AI's potential in detecting suspicious activities, identifying hate speech, and improving the overall digital security
