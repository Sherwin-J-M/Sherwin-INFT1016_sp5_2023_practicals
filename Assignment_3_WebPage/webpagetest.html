                <h2>AI (Artificial Intelligence)</h2>        
                <p>In today's interconnected world, technologies and data have become a part of our daily lives. These emerging technologies that have emerged over the years have started playing a vital role in the world of cyber security, where safeguarding one's digital data is vital. These emerging technologies are reshaping how we defend against malicious cyber-attacks. One of the significant technologies that has appeared is “AI,” short for Artificial Intelligence. The application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) for cybersecurity tasks has attracted a greater attention from both sectors, private as well as public as many organizations have become increasingly concerned about protecting their digital assets or data from any unauthorized access. Many organizations have also become a target of these attacks, especially those that fall under small and medium-sized organizations. AI also serves as a double-edged sword, where it can improve cybersecurity substantially and can also facilitate new forms of attacks that can pose cybersecurity with severe security threats.
                    The following report delves into the profound impact of this emerging technology, AI (Artificial Intelligence).
