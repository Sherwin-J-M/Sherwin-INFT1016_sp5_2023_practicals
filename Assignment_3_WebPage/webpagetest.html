                <h2>Introduction</h2>        
                <p>In today's interconnected world, technologies and data have become a part of our daily lives. These emerging technologies that have emerged over the years have started playing a vital role in the world of cyber security, where safeguarding one's digital data is vital. These emerging technologies are reshaping how we defend against malicious cyber-attacks. One of the significant technologies that has appeared is “AI,” short for Artificial Intelligence. The application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) for cybersecurity tasks has attracted a greater attention from both sectors, private as well as public as many organizations have become increasingly concerned about protecting their digital assets or data from any unauthorized access. Many organizations have also become a target of these attacks, especially those that fall under small and medium-sized organizations. AI also serves as a double-edged sword, where it can improve cybersecurity substantially and can also facilitate new forms of attacks that can pose cybersecurity with severe security threats.
                    The following report delves into the profound impact of this emerging technology, AI (Artificial Intelligence).

                <h2>AI (artificial intelligence) in cybersecurity</h2>
                <p>
                    AI, also known as Artificial Intelligence, is a technology that can understand, learn and act based on its acquired information. It is also said that AI possesses a certain degree of human intelligence. When it comes to cybersecurity, AI is ideally suitable and capable of solving some of the most difficult problems or challenges faced in the realm of cybersecurity. With the constantly ever-evolving cyber-attacks, AI can used as a shield to protect against these attacks through automatic threat detection and also through its more enhanced way of responding more efficiently when compared to approaching traditional software-driven. Machine learning is one of the applications of AI technology.
                </p>

                <h3>Machine learning: </h3>
                <p>
                    Machine learning is also an application of AI technology that uses mathematical data models to help computers to learn without providing direct instruction. This enables computers to constantly continue learning and improving their data on their own based on their experience - 
                    Machine learning is also the most common and primary way most people interact with an AI. Some of these ways are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Receiving video recommendation on an online video platform</li>
                        <li>Scheduling meetings in your calendar, playing a specific song, or calling someone using a virtual assistant who responds to your requests</li>
                    </ul>	
                    Example of how machine learning algorithms are used in cyber security:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Decision tree algorithm—for detecting and classifying attacks</li>
                        <li>K-means clustering—for detecting malware</li>
                        <li>K-nearest neighbours classifier (kNN)—for facial recognition used for authentication</li>
                        <li>Random forest algorithm—for classifying phishing attacks</li>
                        <li>Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm—for classifying, detecting, and predicting blacklisted IP addresses and port addresses  </li>
                    </ul>

                    
                    Types of machine learning in Cybersecurity
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supervised machine learning </li>
                        <li>Semi-supervised machine learning</li>
                        <li>Unsupervised machine learning</li>
                        <li>Reinforcement machine learning</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>Early adopters of AI</h2>
  
                <h3>Amazon:</h3>
                <p>
                    Amazon uses AI to detect and block accounts for any potentially suspicious activity, such as fraudulent activity, and identify and remove these accounts. For example, if a customer account is accessed from a different location, the AI system will mark this as suspicious activity and require the customer to verify their identity before their purchase.
                </p>

                <h3>Twitter:</h3>
                <p>
                    Twitter uses AI to identify hateful comments and uses its AI-powered bots to suspend or remove accounts that promote hate speech.
                </p>

                <h3>Google:</h3>
                <p>
                    Google uses AI in their products to help reduce the burden on its users related to security systems.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gmail: AI is used to filter and block potential spam to prevent phishing attempts as well as malware.</li>
                    <li>Google safe browsing: AI warns users from accessing websites that may potentially contain risks such as malware, viruses, etc.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>NVIDIA:</h3>
                <p>
                    NVIDIA created NVIDIA Morpheus using AI to identify and act on threats and anomalies that were previously impossible to detect.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>NVIDIA Morpheus enables digital fingerprinting by monitoring every user's account, machine, and service to determine when suspicious interactions occur.</li>
                    <li>NVIDIA Morpheus also enables cybersecurity developers to build high-performance pipelines for security workflows with minimal development efforts, resulting in real-time threat detection.</li>
