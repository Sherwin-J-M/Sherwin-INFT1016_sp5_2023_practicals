  <b>Enhancing Cybersecurity:
  The impact, pros, and cons of Artificial Intelligence</b>
 </head>
<body>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>In today's interconnected world, technologies and data have become a part of our daily lives. 
    These emerging technologies that have emerged over the years have started playing a vital role in the world of cyber security,
     where safeguarding one's digital data is vital. 
     These emerging technologies are reshaping how we defend against malicious cyber-attacks. 
     One of the significant technologies that has appeared is “AI,” short for Artificial Intelligence. 
     The application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) for cybersecurity tasks has attracted a greater attention from both sectors, private as well as public as many organizations have become increasingly concerned about protecting their digital assets or data from any unauthorized access. Many organizations have also become a target of these attacks, especially those that fall under small and medium-sized organizations. AI also serves as a double-edged sword, where it can improve cybersecurity substantially and can also facilitate new forms of attacks that can pose cybersecurity with severe security threats.
  </p>
  <p>The following report delves into the profound impact of this emerging technology, AI (Artificial Intelligence). </p>

  <h1>AI (artificial intelligence) in cybersecurity</h1>
  <p>AI, also known as Artificial Intelligence, is a technology that can understand, learn and act based on its acquired information. 
    It is also said that AI possesses a certain degree of human intelligence. 
    When it comes to cybersecurity, AI is ideally suitable and capable of solving some of the most difficult problems or challenges faced in the realm of cybersecurity. With the constantly ever-evolving cyber-attacks, AI can used as a shield to protect against these attacks through automatic threat detection and also through its more enhanced way of responding more efficiently when compared to approaching traditional software-driven. 
    Machine learning is one of the applications of AI technology</p>
    
<h2>Machine learning:</h2> 
<p>Machine learning is also an application of AI technology that uses mathematical data models to help computers to learn without providing direct instruction. This enables computers to constantly continue learning and improving their data on their own based on their experience - 
  Machine learning is also the most common and primary way most people interact with an AI. Some of these ways are:
</p>
<p>•	Receiving video recommendation on an online video platform <br>
•	Scheduling meetings in your calendar, playing a specific song, or calling someone using a virtual assistant who responds to your requests
</p>
Example of how machine learning algorithms are used in cyber security:
•	Decision tree algorithm—for detecting and classifying attacks
•	K-means clustering—for detecting malware
•	K-nearest neighbours classifier (kNN)—for facial recognition used for authentication
•	Random forest algorithm—for classifying phishing attacks 
•	Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm—for classifying, detecting, and predicting blacklisted IP addresses and port addresses   

Types of machine learning in Cybersecurity
•	Supervised machine learning 
•	Semi-supervised machine learning
•	Unsupervised machine learning
•	Reinforcement machine learning

  <h1>Early adopters of AI</h1>
  customer account is accessed from a different location. In that case, the AI system will mark this as suspicious activity and require the customer to verify their identity before their purchase.

Twitter: Twitter uses AI to identify for any hateful comments and use its AI-powered bots to suspend or remove these such accounts that promote hate speech

Google: Google uses AI in their products to help reduce the burden on its users from any related to security systems. 
•	Gmail: AI is used to filter and block any potential spam to prevent any phishing attempts as well as malware.
•	Google safe browsing: AI warns its users from accessing websites that may potentially contain risks such as malware, viruses, etc.

NVIDIA: NVIDIA created NVIDIA Morpheus using AI to identify and act on threats and anomalies that were previously impossible to detect.
•	NVIDIA Morpheus enables digital fingerprinting by monitoring every user's account, machine, and service to determine when suspicious interaction occurs. 
•	NVIDIA Morpheus also enables cybersecurity developers to build high-performance pipelines for security works flows with minimal development efforts, resulting in real-time threat detection.

  <h1>AI disadvantages</h1>
  AI in network security
Due to the way AI algorithm is developed, AI can improve and become more efficient and intelligent, improving network security over time. To improve network security, AI learns and understands more about the organization's network behaviour and analyses the patterns present on the network.

AI can simulate complex scenarios
AI can create bots that can simulate complex scenarios, even mimicking cyberattacks, allowing organizations to test and improve their defences. These battle bots assist in identifying vulnerabilities and evaluating and measuring the effectiveness of these security systems.

Behavioural Biometrics 
Behavioural biometrics uses AI and Machine learning to identify and remember the unique patterns of human behaviour. Behavioural biometrics uses dynamic, individual actions like how a person responds, types and the speed of their action on their devices.

Tackling against Advanced Hacking methods
AI can minimize human errors caused while protecting against advanced hacking methods. They can identify and provide with current data knowledge based on industry and global-specific processes used and identify the potential of what could be most likely used to attack your system.

Enhanced predictive analysis
AI can help predict and prevent cyber attacks before they can occur by analysing and understanding the historical data and identifying various patterns to predict any potential threat and enable the security teams to take a course of action.

Automated security operations
AI and Machine Learning can automate security operations, reducing the workload of security teams. AI can automatically and instantly detect any sort of attack, alert the security team, and suggest mitigation measures in case of a security breach.

Phishing detection
AI detects phishing by working based on its algorithms and focusing on understanding as well as analysing patterns from enormous amounts of data to predict any unusual behaviour and anomalies. It also even evolves over time while learning patterns of normal behaviours. This feature of AI makes it easier to identify for phishing emails, spam, and any kind of malware.

Protecting and managing passwords
AI can be used to generate passwords that are strong and unique by detecting passwords that are reused or weak in strength across multiple accounts. AI can notify users by assessing data from past breaches and inform them when their passwords are in the potential of being compromised.
